# Debug Checklist - Input System Not Working

Let's go through this systematically to find the issues.

## Step 1: Check InputManager Setup

### In Unity Editor:
1. **Is InputManager GameObject in the scene?**
   - Open TitleScreen scene
   - Look in Hierarchy for "InputManager"
   - [ ] Yes, it exists
   - [ ] No, it's missing

2. **Is InputManager component attached?**
   - Select InputManager GameObject
   - Check Inspector
   - [ ] InputManager component is visible
   - [ ] Component is missing

3. **Is InputActionAsset assigned?**
   - Look at InputManager Inspector
   - "Input Actions" field should show: `InputSystem_Actions`
   - [ ] Asset is assigned
   - [ ] Field is empty (None)

4. **Check Console when you press Play:**
   - Look for: `[InputManager] ...` messages
   - Any errors about InputManager?
   - Copy/paste any errors here: ___________

## Step 2: Check if #if UNITY_EDITOR blocks are the problem

The temporary blocks I added might be preventing things from working!

**Quick Test:**
In Unity, go to: **File → Build Settings → Player Settings → Other Settings**
- Check "Scripting Define Symbols"
- Does it contain `UNITY_EDITOR`? (It should by default)

**The issue:** All our code is wrapped in `#if UNITY_EDITOR` which means it's using the FALLBACK code, not the real InputManager code!

## Step 3: We Need to Remove the Temporary Blocks

The temporary `#if UNITY_EDITOR` blocks I added are **preventing InputManager from working** even though it's set up correctly.

**I need to remove these blocks from:**
1. MenuNavigation.cs
2. PlayerController.cs
3. PlayerQTE.cs
4. QTETrigger.cs
5. QTEManager.cs
6. KeybindDisplay.cs
7. KeybindLayoutManager.cs

## What to tell me:

1. **Is InputManager GameObject created and assigned?** (Yes/No)
2. **Any errors in Console?** (Copy them here)
3. **Should I remove all the temporary #if blocks now?** (Yes, please!)

Once you confirm, I'll remove all the temporary compiler directives and your system should start working!
